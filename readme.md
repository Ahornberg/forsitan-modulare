## interea

*interea* transform a V/Oct signal into a chord. It has four chord qualities (Maj7, Min7, Dom7, Half Dim), four inversions (root, first, second, third) and four voicings (close, drop 2, drop 3, spread). When the *harmonize* button is pressed, the frequency input is treated as a bassline and the chord is harmonized with the major scale. This module is inspired by [Strum's Mental Chord](https://github.com/Strum/Strums_Mental_VCV_Modules/wiki/Chord) and the physical module [Chord v1 by Qu-Bit Electronix](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/qu-bit-electronix-chord). See the [manual](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/s/Chord_Manual.pdf) from Qu-Bit Electronix Chord for addition info.
