## interea

![interea](img/interea.png)

*interea* transform a V/Oct signal into a chord. It has four chord qualities (Maj7, Min7, Dom7, Half Dim), four inversions (root, first, second, third) and four voicings (close, drop 2, drop 3, spread). When the *harmonize* button is pressed, the frequency input is treated as a bassline and the chord is harmonized with the major scale. This module is inspired by [Strum's Mental Chord](https://github.com/Strum/Strums_Mental_VCV_Modules/wiki/Chord) and the physical module [Chord v1 by Qu-Bit Electronix](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/qu-bit-electronix-chord).

### how to use

Connect the four outputs to the V/O input of four oscillators. You shoud now be listening to the classic C4 Major7 chord. Play with the *frequency*, *quality*, *inversion* and *voicing* knobs and inputs to play different chord. The *frequency* input is bipolar (+/- 5V), the range of the other inputs is unipolar (0-10V). When the *harmonize* button is on, the chord *quality* is chosen automatically and the *quality* knob and input are disabled. In this state the notes of the chord will be harmonized with diatonic and modal interchange chords of the Major scale. See the [manual](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/s/Chord_Manual.pdf) for Qu-Bit Electronix Chord for addition explanations.
